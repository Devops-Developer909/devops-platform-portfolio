## VNets (Virtual Networks)

## Azure Firewall 

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-native network security service that controls and inspects traffic going in and out of your Azure virtual network (VNet). It acts as a central security gate that determines which traffic is allowed, on which ports, and to which destinations.

### Azure Firewall — Core Components

| Component               | Purpose                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Firewall Rules**      | Allow or deny traffic                     |
| **Application Rules**   | Control HTTP/HTTPS traffic (FQDN-based)   |
| **Network Rules**       | Control IP/Port-based traffic             |
| **NAT Rules**           | Publish internal services to the internet |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Blocks known malicious IPs                |

### Typical Flow
Your PC → Firewall Public IP → DNAT → VM Private IP → SSH

### Route Table (UDR)
To ensure traffic is inspected by Azure Firewall, create a User Defined Route (UDR) on the VM subnet that directs outbound traffic to the firewall's private IP.

- **Route Example:**
   - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
   - Next Hop Type: Virtual Appliance
   - Next Hop Address: `<Firewall Private IP>`

This forces:
VM → Azure Firewall → Internet

### Why UDR is Required for Azure Firewall

1. **Security Enforcement**  
    - Firewall rules apply only if traffic passes through the firewall.  
    - Without a UDR, VMs can reach the internet directly and firewall rules are ignored.

2. **Centralized Control**  
    - One firewall can protect multiple subnets.  
    - Central place to manage outbound rules and logs.

3. **Compliance & Auditing**  
    - Logs for outbound traffic are consolidated.  
    - Useful for regulated environments (PCI, ISO).

4. **Prevent Firewall Bypass**  
    - Without UDRs, a user could assign a Public IP to a VM and bypass the firewall.

### Example Architecture (ASCII)

```
VM Subnet
   |
   | (UDR: 0.0.0.0/0 → Firewall private IP)
   ↓
Azure Firewall
   |
Internet
```

**Firewall Configuration:**
- Firewall Policy → Firewall Rules / NAT Rules  
- DNAT Example: Any IP (*) → Firewall Public IP → VM Private IP

**Recommended High-Level Topologies (Choose One)**

**Option A — Firewall in Front (Perimeter Control)**
```
Internet → Azure Firewall (Public) → DNAT → Application Gateway (Internal) → Internal Load Balancer → VM Backend Pool
```

**Option B — App Gateway in Front (WAF First) + Firewall for Egress/Central Inspection**
```
Internet → Application Gateway (Public WAF) → Internal Load Balancer → VMs
VM Subnet Egress (and/or AppGW Outbound) → User Defined Route → Azure Firewall (for Logging/Inspection) → Internet
```

**Key Design Rules**

- Put each managed service in its own subnet:
   - AzureFirewallSubnet (exact name required)
   - AppGwSubnet
   - ILBSubnet (or Backend Subnet)
   - VMSubnet
- App Gateway must be in its own subnet. Internal AppGW has private IP (used with Firewall DNAT).
- Azure Firewall must be in subnet named AzureFirewallSubnet.
- Internal Load Balancer (ILB) has a private frontend IP and backend pool of VMs (or VMSS).
- Use UDRs to force egress through Azure Firewall: on VMSubnet (and AppGwSubnet if you require inspection of AppGW outbound), route 0.0.0.0/0 → Virtual Appliance → `<AzureFirewallPrivateIP>`.
- Use NSGs to restrict direct access to VMs; allow only ALB/AppGW or specific ports.
- Health Probes: Configure ILB probe and AppGW backend HTTP settings to match app health endpoint.
- DNAT: If Firewall in front, create DNAT rule on Firewall to forward public port(s) to AppGW private IP/port.
- Certificates/SSL: Terminate at AppGW (WAF) or pass-through to ILB/VMs depending on your TLS model.

### Create VNet and Subnets
```bash
az network vnet create -g RG -n VNet --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
   --subnet-name AzureFirewallSubnet --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
az network vnet subnet create -g RG --vnet-name VNet -n AppGwSubnet --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24
az network vnet subnet create -g RG --vnet-name VNet -n ILBSubnet --address-prefix 10.0.3.0/24
az network vnet subnet create -g RG --vnet-name VNet -n VMSubnet --address-prefix 10.0.4.0/24
```

### Deploy Firewall (Requires Public IP)
```bash
az network public-ip create -g RG -n fw-pip --sku Standard
az network firewall create -g RG -n MyFirewall --sku AZFW_VNet
# Configure firewall IPs and NAT rules via portal/az based on DNAT needs
```

### Deploy Application Gateway (Internal or Public)
### (App GW v2 recommended; long command omitted — use portal or ARM template)

### Create Internal Load Balancer -> Backend Pool of VMs/VMSS
```bash
az network lb create -g RG -n ilb --sku Standard --vnet-name VNet --subnet ILBSubnet --frontend-ip-name ilb-fe --private-ip-address 10.0.3.10
# Add backend pool and probe, then add VMs to backend pool
```

### Add UDR on VMSubnet to Route Egress via Firewall
```bash
az network route-table create -g RG -n rtbl
az network route-table route create -g RG --route-table-name rtbl -n default-route --address-prefix 0.0.0.0/0 --next-hop-type VirtualAppliance --next-hop-ip-address 10.0.1.4
az network vnet subnet update -g RG --vnet-name VNet --name VMSubnet --route-table rtbl
```

**Practical Tips / Gotchas**

- App Gateway requires its own subnet and care with UDRs — avoid UDR that breaks platform management traffic.
- If Firewall is in front, use internal AppGW and DNS so Firewall DNAT maps correctly.
- For client IP preservation, AppGW injects X-Forwarded-For; backend VMs behind ILB may see AppGW/ILB SNAT — design accordingly.
- Use probes and matching backend HTTP settings to avoid unhealthy backends.
- Test step-by-step: DNAT to AppGW → AppGW → ILB → single VM before scaling.

### Topology Diagrams (ASCII)

**Option A — Firewall in Front of Internal App Gateway → ILB → VMs**
```
Internet (Public) 
   |
   | (Public IP, DNAT on Azure Firewall)
   v
Azure Firewall (AzureFirewallSubnet) [PIP]
   |
   | (DNAT -> AppGw private IP, or route to AppGW subnet)
   v
Application Gateway (AppGwSubnet) [Private IP - Internal AppGW]
   |
   | (AppGW backend = ILB frontend)
   v
Internal Load Balancer (ILBSubnet) [Private Frontend IP]
   |
   | (Backend pool, health probes)
   v
VM Backend Servers (VMSubnet)
```

**UDR (Applied to VMSubnet):**
```
0.0.0.0/0 --> VirtualAppliance --> <AzureFirewallPrivateIP>
```
(Optional) UDR on AppGwSubnet if AppGW egress must be inspected.

**Notes:**
- Firewall: DNAT rule maps PIP:443 -> AppGwPrivateIP:443.
- AppGW must be in its own subnet (AppGwSubnet).
- ILB provides private frontend and backend pool of VMs/VMSS; probes must match app endpoints.
- NSGs restrict direct access to VMSubnet; allow only ILB/AppGW as source.

**Option B — Public App Gateway (WAF) in Front, Firewall Used for Egress Inspection**
```
Internet (Public)
   |
   v
Application Gateway (AppGwSubnet) [Public WAF]
   |
   v
Internal Load Balancer (ILBSubnet) or AppGW -> Backend VMs (VMSubnet)
   |
   v
VM Backend Servers
```

**UDR (Applied to VMSubnet and/or AppGwSubnet):**
```
0.0.0.0/0 --> VirtualAppliance --> <AzureFirewallPrivateIP>
```

**Notes:**
- Use AppGW public WAF to terminate TLS and protect apps.
- Use Azure Firewall for centralized outbound inspection/logging (via UDR).
- Choose TLS termination point: AppGW (recommended for WAF) or pass-through to VMs.

**Legend:**
- PIP = Public IP
- DNAT = Destination NAT (Firewall NAT rule)
- UDR = User Defined Route (route table forcing egress to firewall)
- Subnet Names: AzureFirewallSubnet, AppGwSubnet, ILBSubnet, VMSubnet
